# ðŸŒ² Evergreen

Yet another one of these static website to display Markdown notes (eg from an Obsidian vault) in the style of Andy Matuschak evergreen notes.

## Why?

A digital garden is a way to think and build in public. This is a powerful tool to develop your thinking.

## Goals

- Make publishing and sharing notes in the Evergreen format as straightforward as possible.
- Make it an intuitive and beautiful experience for the user.

## Evergreen Notes

Evergreen notes are a convenient and natural way to organise thoughts. They are:

- Atomic
- Concept-centric
- Densely linked

## Obsidian

Obsidian is a great, simple tool to browse, edit, and organise a vault of Markdown files. With stacked tabs it provides a similar experience to this UI to linking and browsing notes. Obsidian provides an option to publish notes, but we aim to separate concerns and avoid lockin.

This website developed with React+Vite is a very simplified application to display Markdown files as stacked notes. It is greatly, heavily inspired from Andy Matuschak's notes website: <https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes>. It requires a separate, automated process in order to build an index of backlinks.
