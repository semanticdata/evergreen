# About me

Hello, my name is Miguel Pimentel. I am a self-taught hobby developer with too many ideas and not enough time. I was born in the Dominican Republic, and I currently live in Minnesota, US.

I suffer from a chronic case of curiosity, which leads me to learn and do many interesting things like:

- …designing bike trails and residential roads in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
- …creating my own [browser extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17772574/).
- …teaching [ESL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_second_or_foreign_language).
- …learning web development and computer programming.
- …getting licensed as a Firefighter.
- …getting certified as Emergency Medical Technician.
- …inspecting public road construction projects.
- …working in a construction materials laboratory.

## Work Experience

As an Assist. Contract Administrator for [Metro Transit](https://www.metrotransit.org/), I oversee projects through their installation, construction, and commissioning phases. On a day-to-day basis, I manage multiple projects that tie in one way or another to the public transportation system of the Twins Cities' Metro Area in Minnesota.

With a little over 10 years of experience in public construction, I have amassed a number of unique projects that cover many different fields. It all started when I got my first job as a Civil Engineering Technician for a contracting company near my university. I was at the time attending [INTEC](https://www.intec.edu.do/) while pursuing a Bachelor's in Civil Engineering. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish my college education due to personal problems.

Nevertheless, today I thrive having experience in not only public infrastructure, but technology, electrical, rail, and bus related projects as well.
